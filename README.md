# C Programming

This repository contains C programs which I practised in my second semester for ESCS-291.


## How to Install

1. Create a C virtual environment.
2. Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/shrutika2603/c or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory cd <folder_name>.
4. Run pip3 install gcc.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.
## Usage
1. To run any program (without <math.h>), run  gcc filename.c -o name, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
2. Then type  ./name, and then press Enter to execute successfully.
3. To run any program (with <math.h>), run  gcc filename.c -lm, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
4. Then type  ./a.out, and then press Enter to execute successfully.
